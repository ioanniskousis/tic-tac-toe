<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

The project consists of four code files

- The 'bin' folder

* main
  The main is the executable file that controls the game logic.

- The 'lib' folder

* game.rb
  This class controls the status of the game. Checking the players moves and deciding the winner if any or if the game is over.

* interface.rb
  This class creates the appearance of the game showing the game board and instructions to users.

* centralizer.rb
  This class is basically a helper class to centralize the output in the center of the screen.

## Future Features
  ### Following version may include
  - Graphical User Interface
  - Alternative images for players choises
  
<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Game Rules
* The game is played by two players.  
* It provides a grid 3 x 3 cells, where each player inserts his/her own symbol, usually X or O.  
* The players insert their symbol in rotation, one after the other; always choosing an empty cell.  
* The player's goal is to align his/her symbol in a row, column or diagonal; this results to a game winner.  
* The game may result to NO WINNER, in case there is no empty cell left and no pattern found.  
* In the case of NO WINNER, the players are swapped.  

In our application, players can continue playing after 'game over' for another round; the winner always plays second after each round.
